# App Ideas

## App Idea 1: Tip Diary
**What:**  
Tip Diary is an intuitive, user-friendly app designed to help hospitality workers track their earnings, especially tips, in real time. The app allows users to log their daily tips, calculate weekly or monthly totals, and even estimate taxes on earnings. It can also track other financial goals, like savings or budgeting, to give users a holistic view of their finances. The app integrates with **[Plaid API](https://plaid.com/)** to automatically track and categorize financial transactions, offering detailed insights into spending, earnings, and savings.

**Who:**  
The app is targeted at workers in the hospitality industry, including waitstaff, bartenders, delivery drivers, and anyone who relies on tips as a significant portion of their income.

**Why:**  
Many hospitality workers struggle to keep track of their tips and earnings, which can vary day-to-day or week-to-week. Tip Diary aims to provide a simple solution to this problem, ensuring workers can more easily manage their finances, keep records for tax purposes, and track progress toward savings goals. The **Plaid API** integration will further allow users to see a full picture of their financial activity, including how much they’re earning, where they’re spending, and how much they’re saving.

**Challenges:**  
- Ensuring the app’s tracking system is flexible enough to accommodate different types of workers (e.g., tips based on hourly wages vs. service charges).
- Designing the app to be visually simple and intuitive, especially for users who might not be financially-savvy.
- Competing with more general budgeting apps that might have broader features.
- Ensuring seamless integration with the **Plaid API**, especially in tracking financial transactions, while maintaining strong security and privacy protocols for user data.

## App Idea 2: WeaponTrack (for *Call of Duty*)
**What:**  
WeaponTrack is a gaming app dedicated to tracking weapon progression and mastery challenges in *Call of Duty* (COD). It integrates with the *Call of Duty* API to track weapon stats, allow players to mark which weapons they’ve mastered, and monitor progress toward completing weapon challenges.

**Who:**  
WeaponTrack is aimed at *Call of Duty* players who want a more organized and comprehensive way to track their weapon progression across the game's different modes and challenges.

**Why:**  
*Call of Duty* players often struggle to track progress on weapon mastery challenges across different titles in the franchise. WeaponTrack aims to simplify this by providing players with a centralized place to track their stats, see which challenges are left, and set goals for completing them.

**Challenges:**  
- Integration with the *Call of Duty* API, which may have limitations on what data is available or accessible.
- Designing a clean, engaging UI/UX that displays complex weapon and challenge data without overwhelming the user.
- Standing out in a competitive gaming app market, where players might already use other tracking tools or gaming platforms.

## App Idea 3: ChatFAU
**What:**  
ChatFAU is an app designed to enhance communication between students and educators at universities. It integrates with the university’s Single Sign-On (SSO) system to allow teachers to create communities around courses, study groups, or topics of interest. Students can join these communities, message each other privately or within groups, and receive announcements or discussions from instructors.

**Who:**  
The app is intended for students and educators at universities, particularly those engaged in remote learning or seeking to improve academic communication. It targets students who want easier ways to communicate with professors and classmates, and professors who want to create dedicated discussion spaces.

**Why:**  
With the increase in online learning, there's a growing need for better, more structured communication platforms between students and instructors. ChatFAU aims to close this gap by offering a user-friendly interface for discussions, study groups, and direct communication, enhancing the overall academic experience.

**Challenges:**  
- Integrating with university SSO systems securely and ensuring privacy for users.
- Designing a system that accommodates different user types (students, professors, moderators) while maintaining ease of use.
- Balancing the app’s functionality for both small study groups and larger course-wide discussions.
- Competing with other general communication platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams, which are already widely used in academic settings.
